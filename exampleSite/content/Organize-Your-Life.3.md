I used to have my dogs off the lead everywhere. I’m guilty. I used to walk down busy streets and in busy parks and just let my dogs run free. It’s great to watch your dogs run around and play, but is it necessary, and more importantly is it responsible?

If you have a dog with a 100% reliable recall, meaning that you can recall your dog in the midst of play or when he or she sees another stimuli such as a dog, squirrel, cat or child playing football, then I say, congrats, have your dog off lead because chances are your dog won’t stray more than five feet away from you. But, if you have a dog that when you let it off the lead and it spots another dog across the field, it sprints at full tilt over to it, it is not ready to be off lead.

A dog sprinting up to another dog unsolicited is plain rude in the dog world. Dogs greet each other with manners, and if your happy go lucky dog rushes another dog with an energy level that another dog deems too much, you have a problem on your hands. Not all dogs want to play. Not all dogs like other dogs, and thats okay.

As a dog owner you have a responsibility. It is your job to control your dog. It is your job to train your dog and be accountable for its actions. If there is a dog in the park on a lead, chances are it has a couple of issues, so your dog running up to that dog is not fair. It’s not fair for the dog on the lead, for the owner, and for your dog. That dog on the lead could have some extreme behavioural issues, and your dog greeting it at a million miles an hour may trigger the other dog to react and have a go at him. If you want your dog to play with other dogs, let them play with your friends dogs, family members dogs. But I urge your not to let your dog play with every dog it sees. One of my biggest qualms with this is because your dog is having more fun when he plays with another dog than when he plays with you. This is extremely common, in where people over socialise their dogs. Your dog should want to choose YOU over another pooch. Don’t let your dog have more fun with something else, because he’ll continue to choose that thing. As your dogs owner, you want to be the best thing. You want to be chosen every time. You want to be the one for him to play with.

I’m not saying never let your dog off the lead, if you’re in a park in the rain and there is nobody there, let him off. If your recall is reliable, let him off. But please make sure the recall is reliable. If there is an anxious dog on the lead, the last thing that dog or fellow dog owner wants is a happy go lucky puppy running rings around it. It’s just not fair.

All I ask is that we evaluate our environment, and engage our dogs when we do let them off the lead. Have a toy, play fetch or use it as a training opportunity, but do not let your dog run wild.

If you want to really learn about dog behaviour, manners and general canine etiquette, I urge you to go to your local dog park (without your dog) and look at the interactions between the dogs. Almost always there is a dog thats sprinting like its life dependant on it away from one or more dogs. It’s terrified, but the owner thinks its having fun because its running. Look at the politics between the dogs. Look at the fights, look at the chaos. Watch it unfold. Another fantastic place to go is killiney hill on a Sunday. Killiney Hill is one of my favourite places in the whole of Ireland, but on a sunday afternoon it is insanity. There are hundreds of dogs and hundreds of owners screaming after their four legged friends. There are fights, there are accidents and there is just general shit housery going on. It is not a good environment. It’s actually quite opposite, it’s stressful for most dogs.

A hike up the mountains early morning on a weekday is a much better choice for some off leash time. It’s you and your dog. You’re bonding. You’re throwing stones in a river, you’re giving them some water, and you’re working on the relationship. I would much rather the aforementioned rather than a chaotic walk around a park hoping my dog doesn’t get attacked by another dog.  
Now, I’m not saying live in fear of every off lead dog you see, but I am saying be wary. Every new dog your dog meets is a risk. Of course you can let your dog play with some random dogs from time to time, but judge the situation. Judge the behaviour and body language of the dogs before you let your dog off the lead. For example, If I saw a relatively chilled, relaxed dog on the beach and I was with my dog, I would ask the owner if they minded If I let my dog off the lead to play with theirs. If the owner agreed, I’d let my dog off the lead and let him go play for five minutes. Five minutes. I would not structure my entire walk around my dog playing with a dog he’ll never see again. It’s important and polite to ask a fellow dog owner if they mind if your dog and their dog play. If they have no problem, than you have no problem.

All in all, I think its important to have some empathy for the owners with dogs who don’t like other dogs. They usually have stressful walks, and they’re not helped by off lead dogs. I also think that asking permission for your dog to play with another dog is important. And finally, I think you should avoid really busy parks on the weekends where its a free for all. Take your dog to the dog park, but don’t go in. Work on his or hers obedience outside the fence on a long lead, and watch how the dogs in the park react. There is always a dog that wants to run the dog park, but what happens when you have two dogs that want to run one park?

HAVE A GREAT WEEK!

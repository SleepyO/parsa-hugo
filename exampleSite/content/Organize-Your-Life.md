Relationship building is often over looked when it comes to dog training for the every day pet owner. However, as a trainer, I can’t stress enough how important the relationship you have with your dog is. If you have a solid foundation with your dog, everything else becomes easy. Building the relationship is hard, maintaining it is easier.

I want this post to be helpful and informative, so I’m going to tell you some things you can do with your dog at home to start strengthening that relationship, but first, you must understand how important it is to your life, and the dogs that you have a calm, happy, balanced relationship.

A strong relationship with a dog is unbreakable. To be frank, you get out what you put in. The reason why its so important to work on it constantly, is because it ties into every aspect of your dogs life & their behaviour. Your dog doesn't want to lead their lives, they don’t want to make their own choices. They want to serve you and make you happy. When you’re happy, your dog is too.  
Reactivity cases are usually one or both of the following; Fear, and a lack of leadership/relationship. When your dog knows you’re in charge, in control, and has his best interests, your dog can relax and let you take the reigns. If a dog reacts to certain stimuli its generally because they feel insecure, and they’re not confident with the person on the end of the leash.  
The relationship with your dog is especially important in terms of recall. If you have a rock solid bond, your dog should choose you every time.

So, how do we start building that unbreakable bond? There are a few ways.

1) Do new things together - Take your dog somewhere he’s never been, make it a positive experience. Take your dog, on your own, without family members and partners, and go for a hike. You’ll learn a lot about your dog and you’ll see what really makes him happy. Seeing a dog at his happiest is one of the best things in the world, so put him in his happiest place, but make sure he knows YOU are putting him there. Look for engagement, and constantly reward it.

2) Games - Tug of war is one of the best games you can play with your dog. Why? Because it’s you Vs. Him. You’re in it together, in the war, playing it out. LET HIM WIN, there is no problem with that. It’s no fun if you’re the one to always win, your dog will check out and become disinterested if thats the case. When I play tug with my dog, I win half the time, he wins half the time. It’s a bonding excersize. Throwing a ball for your dog is great, but thats your dog having the fun, you jut kind of stand there looking around, not really invested in it, you can look at other things, go on your phone etc. When playing tug, you have to be present, and with the dog.

3) Training - Teach your dog new behaviours. The great thing about dogs is you can teach them anything you want. Teach them tricks, teach them to play dead, to sit pretty, the list goes on… The more time you spend teaching your dog something, and rewarding him heavily once he understands, the more your dog will want to be in your company.

4) Build confidence - Take your dog somewhere he is a little fearful, and turn that place into heaven on earth. Don’t feed him that morning, bring his food, feed him there. This could be a car park, a shop, busy road, whatever it is, start desensitising and counter conditioning your dog to the place or object he has a fear of. Take it slow, work from a distance, and build it up over time. The more you help your dog with this, the more he’ll love you.  
_Note * Never console or feel sorry for a fearful dog._

5) Do a sport - Join a local agility club with your dog. Better yet, set up an obstacle course in your garden. Get your dog jumping, weaving, and going through things. Again, this build confidence, and gets you and your dog invested in the same thing. Take a few planks of wood, and build something for him. There are a lot of simple things you can do with objects lying around your house. Get creative.

6) Eye contact - Take your dogs food allowance, or treats and hand feed it, but first the dog MUST give you eye contact. Let him look at the treats in your hand, move your hand away from your body, when your dogs gaze goes back to you from your hand, reward him. Constantly tell your dog to sit, get him to give you eye contact and reward.

7) Have boundaries - We can do all the fun things in the world, but we must make sure our dogs have rules and boundaries. You are the human, they are the dog. Be clear in that distinction. Start having your dog respect you. Everything is on your terms, if you want the dog on the couch, fine, no problem, but YOU must invite them up. They should never invade your space without asking permission. I let my dogs jump all over me when we play, but if I’m not paying attention to them, they won’t jump on me. There is a respect there. I respect them, and they respect me. Do the fun things, but be strict on the things your strict about. Don’t let things slide. If you say sit, that dog better sit. No excuses. The more they get away with, the less they’ll start caring about commands from you.  
You don’t have to be on them 24/7, but when the dogs on your time, they must do a you say.

There are a million different things you can do with your dog, but the more stuff you do, the better. Training is the most important in my eyes. That can be training to retrieve a stick, to open the door, to do tricks or to do a flip. It doesn’t matter, as long as you and your dog have your designated time where you’re both present, invested, willing and learning.

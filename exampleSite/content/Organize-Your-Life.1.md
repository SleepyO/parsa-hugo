We all want a calm dog. Well, the majority of us. So what makes a dog calm, how can we achieve this and most importantly, can training make your dog chill?

Having a dog that is calm, confident in new areas, and happy to just chill with his family takes a bit of work, and a bit of luck.  
Lately, I’ve been working with some clients, who want to bring their dogs to work with them. This is good on a number of levels. Firstly, it’s wonderful that places are beginning to allow our four legged friends entry. Slowly but surely, here in Ireland, we’re beginning to follow in the footsteps of our European counterparts, when it comes to dogs.  
I was once in a Michelin star restaurant in Switzerland, only to find a dog laying at the foot of a person at the table next to me. So, is this training?

Yes and no. You can absolutely train a dog to be calm. The same way you can train a dog to be excited. The dogs that get over excited are the ones that have been constantly rewarded for being excited. When the dog is turned on, jumping, and playing they get attention. When that same dog is asleep on the kitchen floor, they’re ignored. It doesn’t take a professional dog trainer to put two and two together. The vast majority of dogs in Ireland are NEVER taught how to be calm. They are almost always ignored when they’re calm, and heavily rewarded when they’re excited.

When we come home and they jump on us, we reward them. When we have friends come over and our dog jumps on our friends, our friends reward the dog by giving it attention and love. When the dog picks up a toy, we play with it. This could go on, but you get the gist.

I believe there are a couple of things you can do if you have an over stimulated dog that finds it hard to switch off.

Firstly, make sure your dog is getting the right type of excersize. A 3km walk for most dogs isn’t really enough. You’re much better having your dog chase a ball non stop for 25 minutes, three times a day, then going for one long 1 hour stroll. The majority of dogs, need to run. Thats how they burn energy. There is a distinct difference in how I feel if I walk 10km, or if I run 10km. It’s the same with your dog.

Secondly, engage your dogs mind. Make sure your dogs mind is switched on. Engage the dogs nose too. Start scent games, and up your training. Plan to teach your dog two new behaviours a week. Often times, solid mental stimulation will tire a dog out, but to really hit the sweet spot, couple the mental stimulation with the physical and you’re laughing.

Thirdly, stop rewarding excitement! When people come over to your house, have them IGNORE your dog. If your dog is looking to play, when it’s not play time, don’t engage. If your dog loses its mind when people come over, but him in a crate until he’s calm. Once he’s settled, he can come out and say hi.

How come homeless peoples dogs are so well behaved? Because they’re treated like dogs. It’s do or die. They excersize a lot, and are constantly on the move, they are with the person 24/7, and the relationship with that person is very different to the every day pet owner. The dogs aren’t treated like children, they’re not anthropomorphised, and they’re not mollycoddled. The dog MUST follow the owner, because well, if they don’t, they’ll probably get killed. I doubt homeless people walk around with a bag of hot dogs and try teach recall on a long line. The dogs work of a primal and evolutionary state a lot of time. The next time you see a homeless person with a dog, firstly, of course give them something if you can, and some dog food for the pooch, but observe how the dog is acting. It’s fascinating.

I challenge you for one month to stop rewarding excitement and reward calm. When your dog is lying on the ground doing nothing, reward him. Give him a treat for relaxing. When he starts getting worked up, walk away. After some time, your dog will start to make the association between reward and mental state. He’ll learn that getting excited and becoming annoying will get him nowhere, and that being calm and quiet will get him everything he ever wanted.  
I won’t fool you, this will not work with every dog. We must be considerate to the genetic make up of the dog. I believe that with a dog it’s 70% genetics, 30% training. An awful lot of folks don’t think of a dogs genetics in assessing the behaviour but it plays a fundamental role in the dogs every day life.  
If you have a Belgian Malinois, and a cat, it’s going to be tough. Sure, some people can make the two live together, but ultimately training won’t take the dogs pray drive away. You can sharpen obedience etc, but that dog will always want to get to that cat, until the day it dies.

Genetics play a huge part in the temperament of a dog, so don’t expect your Dutch Shepard to sit in your office for 8 hours, IT IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. You can go to the best trainer in the world, but that dog will never sit still for that amount of time.

The last thing I want to touch on is the crate. I don't want this post to get into why a crate is essential for a dog and their development, but I want to demonstrate how it can help in creating calm within the dog.  
If you have a puppy, or a dog of any age, and a crate, great. Randomly, throughout the day, put your dog in the crate. Put him in there for short periods of time. For example.

Crate 8 times daily.

1st time - 3 minutes. 2nd time - 10 minutes. 3rd time - 6 minutes. 4th time - 30 minutes 5th time - 15 minutes. 6th time - one hour. 7th time - 15 minutes. 8th time - two hours.

The more you do this, and the more random you make it, the more your dog learns that he HAS to switch off.

Try it, see how you get on. Stop rewarding your dog for jumping up, and start rewarding him for doing nothing.

Thanks.

When someone gets a puppy, the aim for that puppy is to grow into a well mannered, well rounded, respectful member of society. We want a dog we can take anywhere, and is good in all situations. We want a dog thats good with other dogs, thats good with people, thats good with noises, places, and things. So how do we achieve this, and can we do too much of this type of thing with our pups?

The word socialisation is quite loaded. It means many different things to people. Some people think socialisation means taking your dog to a dog park, or letting a million people come up and pet him. The reality of socialisation is that we want our dogs to be NEUTRAL in situations. Situations and scenarios where there are dogs, people, vehicles etc. We don’t want our dogs going nuts to get to another dog, and this is a trend I see more and more of. It is a result of over socialising a dog at a young age.

A pet owner, with the absolute correct intentions, gets a puppy. They want that puppy to be good with other dogs, so they bring it to the dog park over and over. The dog plays with other dogs more and more and more, in turn, creating a want and a desire to be with other dogs, more than wanting to be with the owner. We create unhealthy relationships subconsciously. Socialising your dog with other dogs is integral to their development. We want them to be good with all types of dogs. Short, small, tall, spayed, neutered, not spayed, intact, etc. However, the issues arise when we do too much of this. Ask yourself, would your dog rather play with another dog, than play with you?

I believe the way forward with socialising a young puppy is through structure. I don’t simply let puppies run wild with other puppies. This is why puppy classes etc aren’t the best idea. A brilliant way of socialising your puppy to dogs, is contact a friend, or family member with a stable, calm dog, and get them over to the house. Let your puppy interact with the dog for a few minutes, and then you engage the pup and play with the pup in the other dogs presence. Furthermore, take your puppy for a walk with another dog. Let them exist around another dog without going to say hi. Running up to every dog your puppy sees is not good. It create the love for other dogs more intense, and if your dog runs up to the wrong dog, well then we’ve a problem.

Socialising your dog with people is a tricky one. Mainly because people are selfish, unlike our dogs. People think that a puppy should be so lucky to be blessed with affection from said person, when this really isn’t the case. Again, we want our dogs NEUTRAL in all situations. Any time I’ve a puppy, and people come over, I tell the people to ignore the pup for the first 15, 20 minutes. Once the puppy is calm, they can get some affection for a short period of time. Another way is training your pup in real life situations. Go to a car park, somewhere with people and distractions, and do not let anybody interact with your puppy. This can be hard. Oftentimes people don’t even ask to pet a dog, they just do. You don’t want your puppy getting love from every person who walks passed them, because as the pup gets older, bigger and stronger, they’ll continue to want that affection. It’ll be conditioned, and then we have things like jumping etc. Now, I’m not saying don’t let anybody touch your puppy. But let the interactions be short and sweet. Don’t let the pup go wild. Ask the person to pet the dog for a second, and then have them on their way. Again, go to a busy place with your pup, and work your dog with food, around people. We want dogs, people, and any other environmental object in the universe, to be neutral in the dogs mind.

Sounds. Sounds are one people ALWAYS overlook. One of the best things you can o with your puppy is get them around sounds. Bangs, motorcycles, busses, trains, etc. Get them around these things for short periods. Work them with food, and leave on a positive note. I recreate noises all the time. If I have a puppy, I’ll work it with food, an get my girlfriend to smash pots and pans together, squish bubble wrap, step on cans, etc. The important thing there is that the puppy is still focused on ME. Even though there are background noises. One of the greatest things you can do to build up your dogs confidence when it comes to enviornmental stimuli, is get a paddling pool, fill it with empty water bottles and cans, and get your dog running through it to get the food. These are things you have in your recycling bin and things you can start doing now.  
Another good one for environmental work is go to a garden centre, go to Woodies, B & Q, work your dog in the isle. Play with them. Once the dog has done well, get out of there.

To conclude, socialising your dog, in its essence, it introducing something new where the dog has a positive experience. The most important thing about it, is that when you go to a new place with the dog, you have them engaged and its an extremely positive experience. You must always leave on a good note. One things people make the mistake of doing is staying too long in a place, and then something scares the dog. 3 minutes is all you need. Have your puppy in your car and your getting petrol? Get out of the car with the pup, make them sit 5 times in the petrol station, and then back in the car.

We want our dogs to be stable. To be confident. To be calm. Help them by introducing them to as many things as possible, in a safe engaging way.

Have a good week :)
